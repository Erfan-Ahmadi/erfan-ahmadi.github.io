# Yugen Engine 

Yūgen (幽玄) is an important concept in traditional Japanese aesthetics. The exact translation of the word depends on the context. In the Chinese philosophical texts the term was taken from, yūgen meant "dim", "deep" or "mysterious".

Yugen Engine is an In-House Game Engine we're developing at our company which currently is in it's early stages of development.
