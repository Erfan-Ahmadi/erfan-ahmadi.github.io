I'm Erfan,
An enthusiastic programmer and self-motivated learner currently located in Iran.

I've worked in the Games Industry for ~2 Years, My first Job was Unity3D programmer but **I didn't wanted to use Unity, I wanted to make It**.
and my second job was C++ Programmer I used imgui to develop app ui and sometimes I had to work with dx and opengl stuff but I never had chance to understand them.


I'm a student of Computer Science at Shahid Beheshti Unversity, I think University is a waste of time for me except it forces me to learn good stuff sometimes.

I started this blog to make a commitment to achieve Goals, short-term or long-term goals and write my journey as someone who has little experience in Graphics API's and barely knows about the Graphics Pipeline.

I will try to post C++ and my work-related stuff too,

## What are my Goals about?

Well, right now I'm starting to learn Vulkan API and writing Shaders and try to make a Pro graphics programmer out of my self. Also, I have Data-oriented programming, Unreal Engine, CUDA, OpenCL and a lot of other stuff in mind.
